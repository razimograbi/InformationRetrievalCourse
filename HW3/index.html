  <!-- A. Interesting Technologies -->
  <section id="sectionA">
    <h2>A. List Various Interesting Technologies Used</h2>
    <div class="answer-block">
      <p><strong>1. Urban Dictionary API</strong>: We fetch data from the Urban Dictionary API, and then parse the JSON results in order to add them into our local cache.</p>
      <p><strong>2. JSON Caching</strong>: We store fetched definitions (in <code>urban_data.json</code>) to avoid repeated calls to the API and speed up subsequent searches.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Splitting Queries by “or”</strong>: We added a feature where the user can get multiple definitions in one query by adding “or” between each query. For example: <code>harry potter or john snow</code>.  
      If the user does not add “or,” we treat the entire line as a single query. This approach allows bulk fetching of definitions in a single pass.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Custom Ranking Logic</strong>: Instead of a traditional TF-IDF or other ranking systems, we implemented a custom ranking formula:
      <code>score = (likes - dislikes) - 0.1 x (current_year - year_of_post)</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Search for New Slangs</strong>: We can use an API to return 7 random definitions, call the API 10 times to get a total of 70 definitions, then return the newest terms with the highest score to the user.</p>
      <p><strong>6. Search Using <code>words.txt</code></strong>: If we want to search in bulk, we create a file called <code>words.txt</code>. Each line may contain a query. The code reads the file line by line, fetches definitions for each query, and caches them.</p>
    </div>

  <!-- B. How Long Did Queries Run? -->
  <section id="sectionB">
    <h2>B. How Long Did Your Queries Run, What Does It Depend On, and Can It Be Improved?</h2>
    <div class="answer-block">
      <p><strong>Measured Time (25 seconds)</strong>: Our queries took around 25 seconds to process all lines in <code>words.txt</code>.</p>
      <p><strong>Dependencies</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Number of Terms</strong>: If <code>words.txt</code> has many lines or if each line has multiple sub-queries split by “or,” each sub-query must be fetched individually from Urban Dictionary.</li>
          <li><strong>Network Connection</strong>: Each request to the Urban Dictionary API depends on network speed and the API response time.</li>
          <li><strong>Caching</strong>: Once a term is cached in <code>urban_data.json</code>, subsequent searches for the same term are instant. If no data is cached, we make more calls to the API.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Possible Improvements</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multithreading or Async</strong>: In Python, we could parallelize or asynchronously perform requests to the API.</li>
          <li><strong>Faster Compiled Language</strong>: C++ might marginally improve local text processing speed, though for network tasks, concurrency often helps more than switching languages.</li>
          <li><strong>Reducing or Batching API Calls</strong>: If the API supported multi-term queries in a single request, we could reduce overhead. Currently, that’s not publicly available for Urban Dictionary.</li>
        </ul>

  <!-- Additional Explanation: How The Search Engine Works -->
  <section>
    <h2>Additional Explanation: How Our Search Engine for Urban Dictionary Works</h2>
    <div class="answer-block">
      <p>1. <strong>Reading Input (<code>words.txt</code>)</strong>: We read each line from <code>words.txt</code>. Each line may contain multiple sub-queries delimited by “or.”  
      If there is no “or,” it's just one query; if it has “or,” we split it into multiple sub-queries.</p>
      <p>2. <strong>Cleaning & Normalizing Queries</strong>: We strip leading/trailing whitespace and remove double spaces.</p>
      <p>3. <strong>Caching / Lookups (<code>urban_data.json</code>)</strong>: For each sub-query (e.g., “john snow,” “harry potter”), we check if it exists in the JSON cache.  
      If not cached, we fetch from the Urban Dictionary API, process the definitions (calculating the custom score, censoring any bad words), and store them in the JSON file for future use.</p>
      <p>4. <strong>Selecting Final Definitions</strong>: For each sub-query, we identify the top 10 highest-ranked definitions based on our custom formula.</p>
      <p>5. <strong>User Prompt / Interactive Query</strong>: After processing <code>words.txt</code>, the program prompts the user for a new query. The same steps apply—split by “or,” check cache or fetch from API, then display the oldest/newest/highest-scoring definitions.</p>

  <!-- C. Hubs and Authorities -->
  <section id="sectionC">
    <h2>C. Are There Hubs? Permissions? Give Reasons</h2>
    <div class="answer-block">
      <p><strong>Hubs and Authorities Concept</strong>:
        <br>Yes, in principle each definition text can contain multiple <code>[linked_term]</code> references to other pages. If a particular definition references many other terms, that definition is a potential <em>hub</em>. A definition that many other pages link to (mention with <code>[square bracket]</code> references) could be considered an <em>authority</em>.</p>
      <p><strong>Example</strong>:  
        “harry potter (oldest definition)” references <code>[wizard]</code>, <code>[magic]</code>, <code>[hogwarts]</code>. So it's a potential hub. If “wizard,” “magic,” “hogwarts,” “voldemort,” etc. also contain references back to “harry potter,” then “harry potter” becomes a strong authority.

  <!-- D. PageRank Calculation -->
  <section id="sectionD">
    <h2>D. Select 10 Pages & Calculate Their PageRank</h2>
    <div class="answer-block">
      <p>We did not use every definition for PageRank because it was not feasible. Instead, we took the <strong>words</strong> themselves that the user requested, plus the words <strong>linked inside</strong> each definition, forming a mini-graph of 10 interconnected nodes.</p>
      <p>Below is an <strong>example graph</strong> showing how the user input “lol” expanded into various linked words:</p>
      <!-- Placeholder for your diagram screenshot -->
      <p><img src="Picture1.png" alt="Page Graph from 'lol' to other words" /></p>

      <p>After running our PageRank script for <strong>3 iterations</strong>, these were the results:</p>
      <pre>
PageRank values after iteration 3:
----------------------------------
Word             |  PageRank Value
----------------------------------
too serious      |  0.4446
Too Serious      |  0.2927
in real life     |  0.0830
irl              |  0.0394
partnership      |  0.0394
worthwhile       |  0.0211
lawl             |  0.0211
trace            |  0.0211
lolol            |  0.0211
lol              |  0.0167
      </pre>
      <p>We limited the code to only 10 words. You can see how “too serious” has the highest PageRank value due to the link structure in our example data.</p>

  <!-- E. Show Two Different Users the Ranking & Gather Feedback -->
  <section id="sectionE">
    <h2>E. Two Different Users' Ranking Feedback & Relevance</h2>
    <div class="answer-block">
      <p>We displayed the top 10 definitions (returned by the API) to two users, asking them to mark each definition as relevant (<code>y</code>) or not relevant (<code>n</code>), and recorded precision/recall.</p>

      <p><strong>User 1 Feedback</strong>:</p>
      <!-- Placeholder for user 1 screenshot if desired -->
      <pre>
=== Relevance Feedback ===
For each definition, enter 'y' if relevant, 'n' if not relevant.
Is definition #1 relevant? (y/n): y
Is definition #2 relevant? (y/n): y
Is definition #3 relevant? (y/n): y
Is definition #4 relevant? (y/n): n
Is definition #5 relevant? (y/n): n
Is definition #6 relevant? (y/n): n
Is definition #7 relevant? (y/n): y
Is definition #8 relevant? (y/n): n
Is definition #9 relevant? (y/n): n
Is definition #10 relevant? (y/n): n

=== Evaluation Metrics ===
User 1 - Precision: 0.40, Recall: 1.00
      </pre>

      <p><strong>User 2 Feedback</strong>:</p>
      <img src="Picture2.png">
      <pre>
=== Relevance Feedback ===
Is definition #1 relevant? (y/n): y

Is definition #4 relevant? (y/n): y
Is definition #5 relevant? (y/n): n
Is definition #6 relevant? (y/n): n
Is definition #7 relevant? (y/n): y
Is definition #8 relevant? (y/n): y

Is definition #10 relevant? (y/n): y

=== Evaluation Metrics ===
User 2 - Precision: 0.60, Recall: 1.00
      </pre>

      <p><strong>Observations</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>We showed the top 10 definitions, but the API returns all definitions in practice. Hence, recall is effectively 100% because we are not discarding definitions, just ranking them.</li>
          <li>Since our site is essentially a dictionary, we assume the user typed the correct query. We do not suggest modifying the user’s query (like adding synonyms or related terms). So, we do not propose an adjusted query.</li>
        </ul>
